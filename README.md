## Additional Informations

### Why include Volta

[Volta][volta]â€™s toolchain always keeps track of where you are, it makes sure the tools you use always respect the settings of the project youâ€™re working on. This means you donâ€™t have to worry about changing the state of your installed software when switching between projects. For example, it's [used by engineers at LinkedIn][volta-tomdale] to standardize tools and have reproducible development environments.

I recommend to [install][volta-getting-started] Volta and use it to manage your project's toolchain.

### Writing tests in JavaScript

Writing unit tests in TypeScript can sometimes be troublesome and confusing. Especially when mocking dependencies and using spies.

This is **optional**, but if you want to learn how to write JavaScript tests for TypeScript modules, read the [corresponding wiki page][wiki-js-tests].
